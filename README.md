# Modpack Builder
Script to automatically build modpacks for minecraft forge mods

This README will be filled soon with instructions on how to use the script and a tutorial to create a buildfile json. For now, there is a file called tws-pack.json which is a modpack I personally play with my friends. By now, I hope you can find out yourself how to configure the build json.
